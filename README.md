#### Problem 1 
If you see an error in these few lines delete `new` (in the github its already deleted but your own side) <br>

```gradle
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}
```

#### Problem 2 when starting IDE again
When starting your vs code/android studio/vs/IDE remember to run the following:
1. flutter clean
2. flutter pub cache repair
3. flutter pub get
